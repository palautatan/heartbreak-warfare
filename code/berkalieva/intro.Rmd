I will get to know the dataset
```{r}
# read training data (to build model)
train <- read.csv("../../Data/train_values.csv")
labels <- read.csv("../../Data/train_labels.csv")

# we will use this to assess our model
test <- read.csv("../../Data/test_values.csv")
```


I will want to conduct SuperLearner as well as cross-validated SuperLearner on this data. 

We also need to develop the ROC curve as a measure of performance.

CV.AUC : this will give the AUC and confidence interval without us having to do the calculations





OTHER:
(1) Come up with non-parametric estimate of causal relationship
(2) Give background to the study (question we are interested in), previous findings, present the data, define the parameter of interest, etc.
